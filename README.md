# Selection Sort in C#

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and putting it at the beginning.

## Code Explanation

- The `SelectionSortAlgorithm` function contains the Selection Sort logic.
- The `PrintArray` function is used to print the array before and after sorting.
